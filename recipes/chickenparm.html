    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The details of my life are quite inconsequential...Where do I begin?</p>
    <p>My father was a relentlessly self-improving 
    boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. 
    My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. 
    My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he 
    invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, 
    the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. 
     childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd 
     make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten 
     with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. 
     At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. 
     The Chicken Parmesan you're about to consume reminds me of this time, there really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.</p>
